## Repository Breakdown
This repo contains 3 main files as follows: 
- **actual_notebook**: contains the Jupyter notebook of the project. 
- **auxilary**: contains some auxiliary functions that was used during the analysis. 
## How to Run
To run the project, both **actual_notebook** and **auxilary** should be downloaded and stored under the same directory. After that, **actual_notebook** should be run as any Jupyter notebook. 
## Acknowledgement
I'd like to thank Udacity mentors for helping us down the line. Also, I'd like to thank StackOverflow for providing us with the dataset.Also, I won't forget my friends who helped me proofreed the README and my blog post.
